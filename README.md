# Pool
pool is a database manager that hosts a database for scripts to either temporarily store or cache data. It is a simple database manager that is easy to use and is very fast. It is also very lightweight and is easy to install.

## Installation
this is in beta currently, so you can only run it from source.

## Usage
pool should run in the background and scripts can connect to it using the Pool module.
### Running pool
execute inside the pool directory, the one with the `__main__.py` file in it.
```bash
python -m pool
```
